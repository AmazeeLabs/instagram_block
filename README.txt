INTRODUCTION
------------

This is a very simple module that integrates with Instagram and creates a block
containing your most recent instagram posts.

The block's configuration page lets you choose how many posts and what size they
should appear in the block. The images are individually exposed to the drupal theme
layer, so developers have access to an all of the variables provided by the
instagram api should they choose to extent the block.

For more informations see the instagram developer pages:
http://instagram.com/developer/endpoints/users/#get_users_media_recent
